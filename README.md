## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a [Frontend Mentor's](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY) challenge to build an illustration in CSS and HTML that simulates a chat app.

The page was created using HTML5 and Sass oriented to mobile and Netlify to deployment. I also used the svg icons from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
